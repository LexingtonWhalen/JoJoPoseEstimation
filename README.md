# JoJoPoseEstimation

## Using OpenPose to recognize Poses from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

## :grey_question: What is it?
* Uses CMU's OpenPose to detect key body angles. 
* To detect angles, I use the law of cosines (see prior GitHub repo that I made)
* Compares these frame angles and finds the closest JoJo pose.
## :zap: Features:
* Detects body angles!
* Stores body angles!
* Compares input body angles to stored one!
* Returns the comparison!
* When returned, changes the input frame and plays music!
