This does not contain all the images shown in the video.

To add more images, use the "get_snapshot" python file. Press "f" to get a snapshot of yourself.
This will also show the found angles.

Watch the explanation video (out soon, and when it is it will be in the GitHub desc) for complete guide.

Thanks!
